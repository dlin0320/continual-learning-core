## Quick Fill Guide

### Rating Scale
- `-1`: User frustrated, task failed, or significant rework needed
- `0`: Task completed but with issues, user neutral
- `1`: Task completed well, user satisfied

### Status Definitions
- `success`: Task completed as requested, user satisfied
- `partial_success`: Core task done but with issues or missing elements
- `failure`: Task not completed or completely wrong approach

### Capability Gaps Examples
- "A code formatting skill would have helped"
- "Need a skill for database schema analysis"
- "Missing integration with external API X"
